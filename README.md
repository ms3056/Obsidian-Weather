## Styles
- I have added a few style methods - see the styles.css file to override them with your own snippets. 

## Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-id/`.
- Alternatively you can use the BRAT plugin


## Coffee

If you would like to buy me a coffee this is a way to do that. 

```json
{
    "fundingUrl": "https://buymeacoffee.com/mstam30561"
}
```
